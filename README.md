### Made by Emmanuel Salcedo, Mario Linares, Michael Rojas

Using [PyGame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame)

For development, use [Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
When you first install, activate virtual environment and run 

`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

that way your virtual environment has the same packages.
